# 2048 Game - JavaScript Implementation

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game. The game board is a 4x4 grid where players combine numbered tiles by moving them in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down. When two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. The goal of the game is to create a tile with the value of 2048.

## Features

- **Game Board**: A 4x4 grid initialized with two random tiles (either 2 or 4).
- **Move Mechanism**: Players can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Tiles will merge when they collide with another tile of the same number.
- **Random Tile Addition**: After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) is added to a random empty cell.
- **Win Condition**: The player wins when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
- **Lose Condition**: The game is lost when there are no empty cells and no possible merges left.
- **Score Tracking**: The score is tracked based on the values of merged tiles.
